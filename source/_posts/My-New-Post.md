Testing some stuff out. This is pretty neat way to generate files. I don't know why hugo didn't work, 'cause this is basically the same setup.
Very weird. *This is super weird*.

I'm editing this post on Windows with Visual Studio Code and just having it run in the context of WSL! So now I can do everything within WSL for managing this site, which is a much nicer experience, but I can have a nice text editor other than Nano!
