I wonder how long you can push the post creation. Iâ€™m still unsure about this keyboard, thereâ€™s a lot of extra characters that get created when youâ€™re typing. But I do feel like this switch type is not bad for typing on a conference call, but the problem is that I think the switches are too sensitive to get nice accurate typing. Browns might work, but I wasnâ€™t a <em>huge</em> fan of them when I used them at ABS. They were satisfactory, but Iâ€™m not sure that I shouldnâ€™t go back to them.</p>
