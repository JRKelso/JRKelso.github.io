I wonder how long you can push the post creation. I’m still unsure about this keyboard, there’s a lot of extra characters that get created when you’re typing. But I do feel like this switch type is not bad for typing on a conference call, but the problem is that I think the switches are too sensitive to get nice accurate typing. Browns might work, but I wasn’t a <em>huge</em> fan of them when I used them at ABS. They were satisfactory, but I’m not sure that I shouldn’t go back to them.</p>
