This is a test of the drafts system. I want to get a hang of using Jekyll for blogging and coming up with some ideas for some of my first blog posts. I'm wondering how the bundle exec system will work with testing serving draft versions of the posts. We'll see how it works out. I need to open these markdown files with Visual Studio Code so that I can get a better writing experience, but still work within the WSL.

So here we go. This is now being edited in WSL-run Visual Studio Code. I can see all the files, I can run the server and everything just from within Visual Studio Code. I get all the nice syntax highlighting with markdown as well. I hope this will make a really nice writing platform since I think it will become more and more beneficial to write more in my career. This will get the juices flowing for more thoughtful ideation and concrete some of the thoughts I have about application security as a whole. Most of these ramblings I don't expect to ever push to github, but you never know. It may be my kind of public diary.
