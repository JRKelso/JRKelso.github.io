Hilariously, there's not much to creating a new post, or draft for that matter, within Jekyll. The more point of jekyll-compose is being able to transition files from being a draft to being a full post pretty quickly. It also automates the tediousness of setting up the post with the correct header information and just gets right to the point of writing the blog post. We'll see how we come out ahead with the pages. 

I'm not sure how well this will go down, but we'll see. This theme is also pretyt nice, I'm really liking it. The setup for a new theme is a bit easier. It's also pretty clear that they're not all just Chinese themes. There's a few, clearly, but there's not an overwhelming majority that you have to filter through in order to figure out which one will be English friendly. Though, I do suppose it's nice to see more foreign language content on the internet, even if I can't read a single letter of it.
